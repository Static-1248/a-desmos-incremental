```typescript

$('x') .lteq() .$('y')

// should hinder crashes ...?

// transitionals dont needabe cared.
	const pisr = $.pi .sr();
	// const pisr = $.pi .sqrt();	// never possible as ts context ensured consts' uniqueness

/*
but what are they based on?
1st they can be based on consts.
2nd whatabout variables ...?
--- variables are "explicits".

*/

/*
transitionals: expr & funcs whose references (into other mobjs ...?) are substituted on output
explicits: expr & funcs which takes up a line & whose references are saved on output

*/

// explicits whose uniqueness are maintained via ts value context:




$.If(  )
